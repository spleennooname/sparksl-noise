# SparkSL Procedural Noise Example

![screenshot](https://spleennooname.github.io/sparksl-noise/1.png)

## Intro

A minimal example of using procedural noise in Instagram with [SparkSL](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/learn/sparksl/sparksl-overview), the specific language used by SparkAR to manipulate shaders.

Some functions of IQ(aka Inigo Quilez) the [shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) mastermind, assumed as "gold standard", have been migrated from GLSL:

- [Simplex Noise](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Msf3WH)
- [Gradient Noise](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XdXGW8)
- [Value noise](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/lsf3WH)

Currently a work in progress, feel free to file a PR if you'd like to contribute.

### Notes

 - the code base is versioned to SparkAr v102 
 - the effect has been tested on my iPhoneXR, but it would be interesting to have screenshots of rendering on other devices ;)
