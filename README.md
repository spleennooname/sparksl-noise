## Intro

This is a minimal proof of concept of how to get different types of procedural noise via [SparkSL](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/learn/sparksl/sparksl-overview), the specific language used by SparkAR to manipulate shaders; you can use this code as the basis of your research/experiments.

Much of IQ(aka Inigo Quilez)'s work - the [shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) mastermind - is assumed as "gold standard", in this porting from GLSL.

- [Value noise](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/lsf3WH)

- [Voro noise](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Xd23Dh)

Currently a work in progress, feel free to file a PR if you'd like to contribute. The project is updated to version 117 of SparkAR sdk.

If you like the project and/or find it useful, drop me a star ;)
