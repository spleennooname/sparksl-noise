## Intro

Minimal proof of concept about procedural noise with [SparkSL](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/learn/sparksl/sparksl-overview), the specific language used by SparkAR to manipulate shaders; you can use this codebase for your Instagram filters.

Some functions of IQ(aka Inigo Quilez) the [shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) mastermind, assumed as "gold standard", have been migrated from GLSL:

- [Simplex Noise](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Msf3WH)
- [Gradient Noise](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XdXGW8)
- [Value noise](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/lsf3WH)
- [Worley noise](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tldGzr)

Currently a work in progress, feel free to file a PR if you'd like to contribute.
